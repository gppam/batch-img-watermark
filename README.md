# batch-img-watermark
*Watermarks your photo folder in minutes! Depends on the number of photos that is...*
  
A batch script watermarking tool using ImageMagick. Watermark should be an image and is limited to the bottom left. Resizing and transparency is up to your image editing prowess. *For now.* Don't forget to install ImageMagick if you plan to use this.
